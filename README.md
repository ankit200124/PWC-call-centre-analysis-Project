This project showcases a professional Power BI dashboard for analyzing call centre performance metrics, inspired by consulting environments like PwC. The dashboard offers a dynamic, real-time overview of agent efficiency, customer satisfaction, call resolution, and volume trends and aiding quick operational decisions.

# Project Objective
To build a clear and interactive dashboard that captures and visualizes key call centre KPIs — helping management assess performance, improve customer experience, and streamline operations using data analytics.

# Key Insights Visualized
• Total Call Volume
• Agent Performance (Total Calls, Abandonment Rate, Answer Speed, Satisfaction)
• Customer Satisfaction Distribution
• Call Volume by Day & Hour
• Resolution and Abandonment Trends
• Interactive Filters (Agent, Topic, Month, Weekday)

# Tools & Technologies Used
• Power BI Desktop
• Power Query (M Language) for data transformation
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated fields
• Dynamic Slicers and Buttons for custom interactivity
• Data Cleaning & Sorting to prepare consistent and usable datasets

# Analytical Approach
This dashboard is not just visual — it reflects structured analytical thinking.
Data was cleaned, shaped, and enriched using Power Query. Key metrics such as satisfaction rates, abandonment percentages, and agent response speeds were calculated using DAX. Comparative patterns across time and agent behavior were explored using interactive slicers and visual logic.

# Outcome
An executive dashboard that transforms raw call log data into actionable insights, making it easier for teams to identify improvement areas in agent performance and customer service. This also demonstrates strong analytical, visualization, and storytelling skills in a business context.

# Conclusion:
This project showcases my ability to turn raw service data into actionable insights using Power BI. It reflects strong analytical thinking, KPI structuring and dashboard design tailored for business impact in a call centre environment.
